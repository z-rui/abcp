## Usage

To build, run `make` in `src/`.
`lex` is required to generate scanner from `abc.l`

- `abc2bin` turns ABC into binary
- `bin2txt` turn binary into text

Pipe the two programs to convert ABC into text.

## Use on a Raspberry Pi

- `rpi/gpio_tone` reads binary drives a GPIO output.
- Connect the pin to a buzzer to listen to the music. ðŸŽ¶

## Known bugs

- Some keys (C#, Cb, F#) are wrong.
- Sharp and flat signs apply only to a note; it should apply to the entire measure.
